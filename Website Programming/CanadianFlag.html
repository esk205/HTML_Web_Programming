<p>The first flag that has been known to flown into Canada was the St George's Cross carried by John Cabot when he arrived in Newfoundland in 1497. In 1534 Jacques Cartier planted a cross in Gaspe holding the French Royal coat of arms with the fleurs-de-lis. Cartiers ship had a red flag that had a white cross in it and that was the French naval flag at the time. New France continued to change their military flags of that period.</p>

<p>After the Canadian Confederation in 1867, their was a need for distinctive Canadian flags. One of the first Canadian flags used was the flag of the <a href="http://www.gg.ca/index.aspx">Governor General of Canada</a>, this flag was a Union Flag with a shield in the centre holding the queatered arms of the provinces Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick surrounded by a wreath of maple leaves. In 1870 the Red Ensign, with the Canadian composite shield in the fly, began to be used unoffically on land and sea and was known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Red_Ensign">Canadian Red Ensign</a>. Being one of the new provinces that joined the confederation their shield was added to the coat of arms of Canada in 1921 and 1924. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_in_Council">The Order in Council</a> approved the use of this flag for Canadian government buildings abroad. In 1925, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lyon_Mackenzie_King">Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King </a>established a comittee so the this comittee could design a flag used for home. However this request was dissolved before a final report could be delivered. Regardless of the failure of the comittee to solve this issue, public sentiment in the 1920s was in favour of correcting the flag problem for Canada. Their were new designs proposed in 1927, 1931, and 1939.</p>
