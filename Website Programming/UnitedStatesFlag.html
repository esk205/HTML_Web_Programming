<h3>The first <a href="http://www.usa-flag-site.org/history.shtml">U.S flag</a> to ever be created was made in 1777 and has been changed twenty-six times. When the Flag Resolution was created as the first flag, and was made possible by the Flag Act: "Resolved, That the flag of the United States be made of thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Union">union</a> be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new Constellation.&quot; A women named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betsy_ross">Betsy Ross</a> in 1776 sewed the first American flag. The first battle the United States flag was carried in was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Fort_Stanwix">Siege of Fort Stanwix. </a></h3>

<h3><strong>The Flag Act of April 4th, 1818 provided the 13 stripes and stars be </strong><strong>representative of each state and this change was added onto the flag on July 4th which was the following admission of each new state and was signed by President Monroe. The Executive Order of President Tafted in June 24, 1912 established a new design to the flag and this changed the arrangement of the stars, in six horizontal rows of eight each and a single point of each star to be pointing upward which totals up to forty-eight stars. Throughout the 19th centurey the stars have been arranged to a variety of shapes from rectangles to circles. In July 4th, 2007 the fifty star flag became the version that was the most used.</strong></h3>
